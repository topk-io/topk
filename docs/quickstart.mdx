This quickstart guide will walk you through setting up and using TopK in less than 5 minutes. By the end, you'll know how to:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a collection">
    Create a collection that stores your data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Insert initial data">
    Add documents to your collection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search your collection">
    Learn how to use various searching methods:
   - **Semantic search** -- finding content by semantic meaning
   - **Keyword search** -- finding exact text matches and sorting by keyword score
   - **Metadata filtering** -- narrowing down results by document properties
   - **Reranking** (optional) -- use built-in reranking to boost relevant results
  </Step>
</Steps>

Follow along to build your first functional search experience with TopK\!

Before starting, ensure you have the TopK SDK installed and your API key ready - see the [Installation](/installation) docs.

## 1. Create your first collection

Collections are the core data structure in TopK. They store documents and provide an interface for querying your data.

First, initialize a TopK `Client` instance with your [API key](/installation#api-key) and
<Tooltip tip="TopK region is where your data is stored. It maps to a specific cloud region.">region</Tooltip>.
Check out the [Regions](/regions) page for more information.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from topk_sdk import Client

client = Client(api_key="YOUR_TOPK_API_KEY", region="aws-us-east-1-elastica")
```


```typescript Javascript
import { Client } from "topk-js";

const client = new Client({
  apiKey: "YOUR_TOPK_API_KEY",
  region: "aws-us-east-1-elastica"
});
```

</CodeGroup>

Then, create a collection by specifying a schema. The example below creates a `books` collection with a **semantic index** on the `title` field.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from topk_sdk.schema import text, semantic_index

client.collections().create(
    "books",
    schema={
        "title": text().required().index(semantic_index()),
    },
)
```


```typescript Javascript
import { text, semanticIndex } from "topk-js/schema";

await client.collections().create("books", {
  title: text().required().index(semanticIndex()),
});
```

</CodeGroup>

Adding a [`semantic_index()`](/collections/create#semantic-index) to the `title` field enables
[**semantic search**](/concepts/semantic-search) as well as [**keyword search**](/concepts/keyword-search) on this field.

<Tip>
  Fields that aren't defined in the schema can still be upserted.
</Tip>

## 2. Add documents

After creating a collection, you can start adding documents to it.

Documents in TopK are JSON-style dictionaries which must **must** have an `_id` field:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
client.collection("books").upsert(
    [
        {"_id": "gatsby", "title": "The Great Gatsby"},
        {"_id": "1984", "title": "1984"},
        {"_id": "catcher", "title": "The Catcher in the Rye"},
    ],
)
```


```typescript Javascript
await client.collection("books").upsert([
  { _id: "gatsby", title: "The Great Gatsby" },
  { _id: "1984", title: "1984" },
  { _id: "catcher", title: "The Catcher in the Rye" },
]);
```

</CodeGroup>

## 3. Query your collection

Now, run your first **semantic search** query:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from topk_sdk.query import select, fn, field

results = client.collection("books").query(
    select(
        "title",
        # fn.semantic_similarity() scores documents by how semantically similar their titles are to "classic American novel"
        title_similarity=fn.semantic_similarity("title", "classic American novel"),
    )
    # Sort results by `title_similarity` (computed in the `select()` function above), and limit to top 10 results
    .topk(field("title_similarity"), 10)
    # Rerank results using the built-in reranking model
    .rerank()
)
```


```typescript Javascript
import { select, fn, field } from "topk-js/query"

const results = await client.collection("books").query(
  select({
    title: field("title"),
    // fn.semantic_similarity() scores documents by how semantically similar their titles are to "classic American novel"
    title_similarity: fn.semanticSimilarity(
      "title",
      "classic American novel"
    ),
  })
    // Sort results by `title_similarity` (computed in `select()` above), and limit to top 10 results
    .topk(field("title_similarity"), 10)
    // Rerank results using TopK's built-in reranking model
    .rerank()
);
```

</CodeGroup>

Optionally, you can call `.rerank()` at the end of your query to automatically improve relevance of the results using a reranking model. See [Reranking](/documents/query#reranking) guide for more details.

## 4. (Optional) Clean up

To delete the entire collection:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
client.collections().delete("books")
```


```typescript Javacript
await client.collections().delete("books")
```

</CodeGroup>
