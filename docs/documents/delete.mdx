title: "Delete documents"
---

You can delete documents by their `_id` or using an [expression](https://docs.topk.io/documents/query#filtering). Both methods provide
the same consistency guarantees and will be reflected in query/get results according to your [consistency level](https://docs.topk.io/concepts/consistency).

To delete documents by their `_id`, you can pass a list of `_id`s to the `delete()` function:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
client.collection("books").delete(
    ["book-1", "book-2", "book-3"]
)
```

```typescript Javascript
await client.collection("books").delete(["book-1", "book-2", "book-3"]);
```

</CodeGroup>

To delete documents that match a predicate, you can pass a [filter expression](https://docs.topk.io/documents/query#filtering) to the `delete()` function.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from topk_sdk.query import field

client.collection("books").delete(field("published_year").lt(1997))
```

```typescript Javascript
import { field } from "topk-js/query";

await client.collection("books").delete(field("published_year").lt(1997));
```

</CodeGroup>
