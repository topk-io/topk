title: "Reranking"
---

Vector search or keyword-based functions (like BM25 or ANN) can fetch the right ballpark of results quickly, but the **order might not reflect true relevance**.

Reranking is used to improve relevance and accuracy. TopK comes with a built-in reranking functionality using the `rerank()` function.

## `rerank()`

The `rerank()` function is called on the query instance and accepts the following parameters:

<ParamField query="model" type="string" default="cohere/rerank-v3.5">
  The model to use for reranking. Currently, only [`cohere/rerank-v3.5`](https://cohere.com/blog/rerank-3pt5) is supported.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="query" type="string" optional>
  The query text to rerank against. Uses arguments from `semantic_similarity()` function if not specified.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="fields" type="string[]" optional>
  List of fields to use for reranking. Uses fields from `semantic_similarity()` function if not specified.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="topk_multiple" optional>
  Multiple of top-k to rerank. For example, if `topk=10` and `topk_multiple=2`, reranker takes 20 results from the original query and returns the top 10 results.
</ParamField>

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
.rerank()

# or

.rerank(
    model="cohere/rerank-v3.5",
    query="catcher",
    fields=["title", "description"],
    topk_multiple=2
)
```


```typescript Javascript
.rerank()

// or

.rerank({
  model: "cohere/rerank-v3.5",
  query: "catcher",
  fields: ["title", "description"],
  topkMultiple: 2,
})
```
</CodeGroup>

## Lexical scoring with reranking

Consider the following example for searching documents with the `"how to reset a router"` query:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
client.collections().create(
    "documents",
    schema={
        "title": text().index(semantic_index()).required(),
        "content": text().index(semantic_index()).required(),
    }
)

client.collection(name).upsert([
    {
        "_id": "1",
        "title": "How to reset router settings to fix intermittent connectivity",
        "content": "To fix intermittent connectivity issues related to your device, you need to unplug your modem or router for 10 seconds, then plug them back in. This will cause a reset of the network hardware and often resolves temporary disruptions.",
    },
    {
        "_id": "2",
        "title": "How to reset your device",
        "content": "Factory reset procedures vary by device. Press and hold the reset button for 10 seconds. This clears all settings, returning the router to default configuration.",
    },
])

client.collection(name).query(
    select(
        "title",
        "content",
        title_score=fn.bm25_score()
    )
    .filter(match("how to reset a router", field="title"))
    .topk(field("title_score"), 10)
)

# Results:

[
    {
        "_id": "1",
        "title": "How to reset router settings to fix intermittent connectivity",
        "title_score": 0.942161500453949,
        "content": "To fix intermittent connectivity issues related to your device, you need to unplug your modem or router for 10 seconds, then plug them back in. This will cause a reset of the network hardware and often resolves temporary disruptions.",
    },
    {
        "_id": "2",
        "title": "How to reset your device",
        "title_score": 0.4156554341316223,
        "content": "Factory reset procedures vary by device. Press and hold the reset button for 10 seconds. This clears all settings, returning the router to default configuration.",
    }
]
```


```typescript Javascript
await client.collections().create("documents", {
  title: text().index(semanticIndex()).required(),
  content: text().index(semanticIndex()).required(),
});

await client.collection(name).upsert([
  {
    _id: "1",
    title: "How to reset router settings to fix intermittent connectivity",
    content:
      "To fix intermittent connectivity issues related to your device, you need to unplug your modem or router for 10 seconds, then plug them back in. This will cause a reset of the network hardware and often resolves temporary disruptions.",
  },
  {
    _id: "2",
    title: "How to reset your device",
    content:
      "Factory reset procedures vary by device. Press and hold the reset button for 10 seconds. This clears all settings, returning the router to default configuration.",
  },
]);

const docs = await client.collection(name).query(
  select({
    title: field("title"),
    content: field("content"),
    title_score: fn.bm25Score(),
  })
    .filter(match("how to reset a router", { field: "title" }))
    .topk(field("title_score"), 10)
);

// Results:

  {
    _id: '1'
    title: 'How to reset router settings to fix intermittent connectivity',
    title_score: 0.942161500453949,
    content: 'To fix intermittent connectivity issues related to your device, you need to unplug your modem or router for 10 seconds, then plug them back in. This will cause a reset of the network hardware and often resolves temporary disruptions.',

  }
]
```

Lexical scoring methods like BM25 rely on **exact term overlap**. Here's how they score:

Document `"1"` is ranked higher because:

- It contains `"how"`, `"to"`, `"reset"`, `"router"` (some of which match the query directly).
- Phrases like `"how to reset router"` appear close together.

Document `"2"` is ranked lower because:

- Although it describes a true factory reset, it doesnâ€™t include the exact phrase `"how to reset a router"` but includes `"how to reset your device"`.
- The term `"router"` might not appear (assume it uses `"device"`).

Lexical scoring is useful for keyword-based search, but it doesn't capture the **true user intent** - a guide on how to reset a router.

### using rerank() to boost relevant results

Let's apply the `rerank()` passing the `"how to reset a router"` query matching against the `"content"` field to rerank the results:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
client.collection(name).query(
    select(
        "title",
        "content",
        title_score=fn.bm25_score(),
    )
    .filter(match("how to reset a router", field="title"))
    .topk(field("title_score"), 10)
    .rerank(
        fields=["content"],
        query="how to reset a router"
    )
)

# Results:

[
    {
        "_id": "2",
        "title": "How to reset your device",
        "title_score": 0.4156554341316223,
        "content": "Factory reset procedures vary by device. Press and hold the reset button for 10 seconds. This clears all settings, returning the router to default configuration.",
        "_rerank_score": 0.8374209403991699
    },
    {
        "_id": "1",
        "title": "How to reset router settings to fix intermittent connectivity",
        "title_score": 0.942161500453949,
        "content": "To fix intermittent connectivity issues related to your device, you need to unplug your modem or router for 10 seconds, then plug them back in. This will cause a reset of the network hardware and often resolves temporary disruptions.",
        "_rerank_score": 0.6334335207939148
    }
]

```


```typescript Javascript
const docs = await client.collection(name).query(
  select({
    title: field("title"),
    content: field("content"),
    title_score: fn.bm25Score(),
  })
    .filter(match("how to reset a router", { field: "title" }))
    .topk(field("title_score"), 10)
    .rerank({
      fields: ["content"],
      query: "how to reset a router",
    })
);

// Results:

[
  {
    _id: '2',
    title: 'How to reset your device',
    title_score: 0.4156554341316223
    content: 'Factory reset procedures vary by device. Press and hold the reset button for 10 seconds. This clears all settings, returning the router to default configuration.',
    _rerank_score: 0.8374209403991699,
  },
  {
    _id: '1',
    title: 'How to reset router settings to fix intermittent connectivity',
    title_score: 0.942161500453949,
    content: 'To fix intermittent connectivity issues related to your device, you need to unplug your modem or router for 10 seconds, then plug them back in. This will cause a reset of the network hardware and often resolves temporary disruptions.',
    _rerank_score: 0.6334335207939148
  }
]
```
</CodeGroup>

As you can see, using the `rerank()` function, the relevance of the results is improved - the actual guide on how to reset a router is ranked higher,
even though keyword `"router"` does not appear in the `"title"` field.
